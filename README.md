# Machine Learning Techniques
___
This project focused on different machine learning techniques using Python. Part of the IBM Professional Data Science Certificate through Coursera, the project provides data on loans. The project is to predict which loans will be paidoff and which will go into collections. Based on the loan data, the data was split into train and test sets. Models were created and trained using the data. Techniques used included K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and logisitic regression.

After the models were trained, a test data set was provided. The test data set was ran through the models and the prediction percentage reported.
